# iPodNano-Wallpaper-Sorter

This tool processes full-resolution and thumbnail background images, renaming and copying them for each iPod Nano 7G color (6G support coming soon). 

## How to Use

### Step 1: Create the Base Backgrounds
- Design the base backgrounds.  
- Ensure they are compatible with the iPod's `0064` format.  

### Step 2: Prepare Input Files
- Place all full-resolution and thumbnail background images into the `input` folder.  

### Step 3: File Naming
- Name the full-resolution backgrounds using this format:  
  **`Full (Number).png`**  
  *Example:* `Full 1.png`  
- Name the thumbnail backgrounds using this format:  
  **`Thumb (Number).png`**  
  *Example:* `Thumb 1.png`  

Your `input` folder should look like this:  
![Example Input Folder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9a18473-d07c-44ff-b63a-4116d7dc00e5)

### Step 4: Run the Script
- Execute the Python script.  
- Copy and replace the generated background files into the `body` folder.
